# Contributing

Please read through the index [README](README.md), the READMEs the index links to, and
[pkmn.cc/@pkmn](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn/) for general information about EPOk√© and about development
on `@pkmn` projects respectively. When opening issues or pull requests, please use one of the
existing templates and fill them out to the best of your ability. Pull requests are unlikely to be
merged without tests, but it is fine to open a pull request without tests for feedback or to ask for
help with testing. :)
