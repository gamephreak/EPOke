EPOké project.


> [EPOké](https://pkmn.cc/epoke) (named after a portmanteau of
[EPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin) and ‘Poké’) [is](https://pkmn.cc/vaporware.png)
an enhanced Pokémon battling client library is an enhanced Pokémon battling client library which
tracks information not only about the observed battle situation, but also uses the mechanics of the
game, reverse damage calculation, and usage statistics to infer as much as possible about the state
of play (including but not limited to an opponent Pokémon’s moves/spreads/items/abilities). EPOké is
designed to be useful in many domains — exposing additional information from replays, extending the
Pokémon Showdown client tooltips/UI, or inside the engine of a Pokemon AI.
